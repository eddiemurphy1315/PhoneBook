# PhoneBook
</P>Core Features
Contact Management:
Add Contacts: Users should be able to create new contact entries, including details such as name, phone number, email address, and physical address.
Edit and Delete Contacts: Users must have the ability to modify existing contacts or remove them entirely from the application.
Search Functionality:
Implement a search bar that allows users to quickly find contacts by name or other attributes.
Grouping and Categorization:
Enable users to categorize contacts into groups (e.g., family, friends, work) to simplify organization and retrieval. This can help avoid confusion when multiple contacts share the same name.
Call and Message Integration:
Allow users to initiate calls or send messages directly from the app by tapping on a contact's phone number or email address, which should link to the deviceâ€™s native calling or messaging applications.
Cloud Backup and Sync:
Consider integrating cloud storage options for backing up contacts, ensuring that users do not lose their data if they switch devices or experience data loss.
